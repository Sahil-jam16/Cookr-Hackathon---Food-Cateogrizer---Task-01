------------------------------

multiple attributes for each food item, and you should create a model to categorize the items into various classes or categories for several target variables like "Meal_Type," "Cuisine_Type," and "Health_Benefits."

Here's a suggested approach:

Attributes:
Features (Attributes):
Ingredients(This is a string tuple which can more than one string values)
Diet
Flavor
Protein Content
Carbohydrate Content
Meal Type
Cuisine Type
Preparation Method
Health_Benefits(This is a string tuple which can more than one string values)

Target Variables:
Meal Type: Categories like Breakfast, Main Course, Snack, Dessert, etc.
Cuisine Type: Categories like South Indian, North Indian, West Indian, etc.
Health Benefits: Categories like High Fiber, Diabetic Friendly, Gluten-Free, Bone Health, Pregnancy Friendly, Immune Boosting.

Modeling Approach:
Data Preprocessing:
Encode categorical variables (e.g., Diet, Flavor) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
And carefully apply the correct preprocessing for the ingredients and health_benefits which will be used for training the model, 
Handle missing values if any.
Convert text-based ingredients into a format suitable for analysis.

Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Also for training the data you should consider the ingredients, flavour, Diet Carbohydrate content column im saying this because you have left those columns when tryin to solve this in the previous prompts

Random Forest Model:
Use a Random Forest algorithm for multi-class classification.
Each target variable (Meal Type, Cuisine Type, Health Benefits) will be treated as a separate classification task.
Train three separate Random Forest models, one for each target variable.

Handling New Dishes:
When a new dish is introduced:
Extract relevant attributes (Ingredients, Diet, Flavor, Carbhohydrate_Content, Protein).
Use the trained models to predict the values for each target variable.
The model should provide predictions for Meal Type, Cuisine Type, and Health Benefits based on the input attributes.
Ensemble of Models:

Combine the predictions from the three models to generate a comprehensive categorization for the new dish and try to print out the output for the new dish's categorization.
